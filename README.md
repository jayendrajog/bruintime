Update 9-11-15: Analysis page is now functional; it displays average grade for classes from
every major in order lowest average GPA -> highest average GPA. 



Home page is created using particles.js, an opentype font, and bootstrap

Grades page uses bootstrap, charts.js, and bootstrap-select for the front end

For the backend, the Grades page uses a LAMP stack: data is added to a mysql database 
and accessed and manipulated by using PHP. AJAX is then used in combination with jquery 
to present the data.

About page is currently still under construction
